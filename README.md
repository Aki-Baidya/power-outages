# power-outages
Final Project in DSC 80 at UC San Diego

So far, we have run a permutation test to check whether the climate category has a correlation with the time it takes to restore power. Upon doing a simple permutation test and checking the absolute difference between normal and warm climates, we get a p-value of 0.296, which signifies that the difference is not by chance alone.
